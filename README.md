# `/pullrequest` — PR Pipeline Skill for Claude Code

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill that automates the entire PR lifecycle: **self-check → create PR → AI code review → merge**.

It triggers **Codex** and **Copilot** reviews simultaneously, waits for both in a unified polling loop, validates each comment, auto-fixes real issues, declines noise, and merges when ready.

```
/pullrequest          # auto-merge after review
/pullrequest wait     # ask before merge
```

### Review loop details

Both reviewers are triggered simultaneously and tracked in a **unified polling loop** (every 60s, up to 15 attempts). The loop waits for **both** bots to respond — it does not exit when only one has replied. Codex responds primarily via **issue comments**, while Copilot uses reviews + inline comments.

After polling, comments from both bots are processed. Each comment is tracked by `in_reply_to_id` — only truly unprocessed comments are handled:

- **Valid comment** (bug, vulnerability, side effect) → fix code, push, reply `Fixed: ...`
- **Invalid comment** (subjective, over-engineering) → reply `Declined: ...`
- After each push → re-poll only the bot whose comments triggered fixes, up to 10 iterations per bot

### Graceful degradation

| Codex | Copilot | What happens |
|:-----:|:-------:|:-------------|
| ✅ | ✅ | Full pipeline — trigger both, unified poll, process both |
| ✅ | ❌ | Trigger Codex only, poll for Codex only |
| ❌ | ✅ | Trigger Copilot only, poll for Copilot only |
| ❌ | ❌ | Self-check only → create PR → merge |

The skill **never fails** because a reviewer bot is unavailable.

## What the self-check does

Before creating a PR, the skill automatically:

1. Reads `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` project rules
2. Recalls the original task and checks completeness
3. Detects and runs your project's test suite (`npm test`, `pytest`, `go test`, `cargo test`, etc.)
4. Runs linter if available
5. Scans for hardcoded secrets, leftover debug output, unresolved TODOs

## Comment validation rules

The skill doesn't blindly accept every reviewer suggestion. It applies consistent criteria:

| Always fix | Always decline |
|:-----------|:---------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | "Consider X instead of Y" without reasoning |
| Logic bugs | Patterns the project explicitly avoids |
| Data loss / corruption risks | Premature optimization |
| Race conditions | Abstraction layers for single-use code |
| Missing null checks at boundaries | Style contradicting project conventions |

## FAQ

**Q: What if I don't have Codex or Copilot?**
A: The skill works without either. It will self-check, create the PR, and proceed to merge.

**Q: Can I use this with a fork-based workflow?**
A: This template is designed for direct-push workflows (you push to origin). For fork-based workflows, you'll need to adjust the remote names and PR creation commands.

**Q: What merge strategy does it use?**
A: Squash merge (`--squash --delete-branch`) by default.

**Q: What if a review comment is wrong?**
A: The skill evaluates each comment against validation rules and declines invalid suggestions with a reason. You'll see a report of what was fixed vs declined.
